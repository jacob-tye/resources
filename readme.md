Extensions are an important part of using vscode. They allow you to have a light weight IDE that is still super powerful.

### Set up
1. Copy [extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) to the folder .vscode in the folder you will be coding in (create the folder if nessecary)

2. Go through [extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json) and choose the extensions that you want

3. Download the suggestions by hiting ctrl-shift-p (cmd-shift-p on mac) and typing 'Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions' and clicking the download button
