# Shortcuts

Learning keyboard shortcuts is a great way to make vs-code work for you. These keyboard shortcuts can be configured either through preferences or by installing extensions. If you are already use to the key board shortcuts of another program, like vim or atom, you can install an extension to automatically apply those to your vs code. If you are on a mac, just change any ctrl to cmd.

## Helpful shortcuts

You can view all your keyboard shortcuts by hitting ctrl-shift-p and typing "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts"
